# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Additionally add your API keys in the api.js file to make sure the application works correctly.

# Problems:

During the course of this project, I encountered an issue wherein the minimum and maximum temperatures for a given day in any city remained constant, irrespective of the specific day or city. I believe this discrepancy is attributable to an anomaly in the API call and anticipate that OpenWeather will promptly address and rectify this matter.
